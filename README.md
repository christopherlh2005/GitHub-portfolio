Here is a collection of my favorite personal projects. There are more detailed READMEs in each folder. Additionally, both projects have video overviews (both under 3 mins) showing you the projects in action and explaining the code quickly.

## Depression Classifier 

This project is a way to fight the mental health crisis by identifying people with depression based on their social media posts. It is trained on 2 million Reddit posts (a mixture of actual posts showing depression and control group posts). The classifier uses LDA (Latent Dirichlet allocation) and roBERTa embeddings to train a RandomForestClassifier to classify specific posts as either depression related or not. The program achieves approximately 85% accuracy (ignore LDA accuracy). I coded it using the pyTorch, sklearn, and Hugging Face transformers libraries.
