# Project Details
- Project Name: Broadband Search Application
- Team Members: clho, gwang71

We designed an application that allows the user to load csv files onto
the backend server, and then view the data in tabular or bar graph form
and search a selected csv file for keywords. The application also allows
the user to search the Census API using state and county to get the
corresponding broadband percentage.
